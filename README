GUI

gui.java     - main class (compile and run it to start the program)
/main/       - contains custom panel classes, one for(almost) 
               every section of the main frame
/service/    - contains service classes (data containers and etc.) 
               to simplify operation
/custom/     - contains custom action listeners, threads and 
               a file chooser class
/lib/        - external libraries (jfreechart, miglayout)

It's very likely this vertion of Gui is not fast enough 
to handle real data streams. This will require additional 
modifications.
